# todo-list
I built this application in an effort to learn about file reading and writing in Java. Though it was originally a bit of an experiment, it has become one of the most useful applications I have created. The application initializes a series of Course objects from the Course class which read in an array of "checks", weekly or daily tasks that need to be completed for each course I'm enrolled in, for work, or in my personal life. The homeworkcheck class then asks the user whether each task has been completed and outputs a todo list named with the date and time of its creation. I keep a batch file on my desktop and run this app nearly every morning.
